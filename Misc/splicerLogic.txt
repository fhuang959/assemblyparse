vamos a ver....

Replicate opening statements till fNames (open, read files, put into code, populate fNames)


*@perhaps*
replicate full Parser program.
Create new keys in value dict of similar purpose to existing 'code' key
    Run check to see if calls in fCalled are in fNames
    if(in fNames) then create new 'code_fxnName' key and have list of code as value

things to figure out:

-how to have assembly file as output
-how to format assembly?

***Recursive Search***

Some sort of recursion

Create a list [] of assmiliated methods

Get a method from user
Append all 'methods* from fCalled[] to assimilated list
Get code for all methods 
Rinse and repeat
